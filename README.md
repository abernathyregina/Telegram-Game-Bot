3. **Output or Action** — The bot posts updates, sends rewards, and maintains live leaderboards automatically.  
4. **Other Functionalities** — Includes retry handling, logging, multi-threaded device execution, and error recovery through the Appilot control panel.

**Language:** Python, Java, Kotlin  
**Frameworks:** Appium, UI Automator, python-telegram-bot, Robot Framework  
**Tools:** Appilot, ADB, Accessibility API, Bluestacks, Scrcpy, Firebase Test Lab  
**Infrastructure:** Dockerized emulator clusters, real device farms, proxy-enabled accounts, task queues, and real-time logging servers.
